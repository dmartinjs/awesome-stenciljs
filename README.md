## Stencil Tesing

- [Unit Testing](https://stenciljs.com/docs/unit-testing)
- [End-to-end Testing](https://stenciljs.com/docs/end-to-end-testing)
- [Screenshot Visual Diff](https://stenciljs.com/docs/screenshot-visual-diff)

> Testing within Stencil is broken up into two distinct types: Unit tests and End-to-end (e2e) tests. Both types use Jest as the JavaScript testing solution. The browser environment for end-to-end testing is done using Puppeteer

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
- [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) - a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol
