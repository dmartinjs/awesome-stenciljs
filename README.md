## Stencil Tutorials

### Stencil General Tutorials



### Stencil and JSX

> JSX, or JavaScript XML , is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax. Similar in appearance to HTML, JSX provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers.

- [JSX in Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/docs/templating-jsx)

### Stencil and Typescript

> TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

- [Blaze](https://github.com/BlazeSoftware/blaze) - Framework-free open source UI toolkit. It provides great structure for building websites quickly with a scalable and maintainable foundation.
- [Bulmil](https://github.com/Gomah/bulmil) - An agnostic UI components library based on Web Components, made with Bulma & Stencil.

### Stencil Testing

- [Unit Testing](https://stenciljs.com/docs/unit-testing)
- [End-to-end Testing](https://stenciljs.com/docs/end-to-end-testing)
- [Screenshot Visual Diff](https://stenciljs.com/docs/screenshot-visual-diff)

> Testing within Stencil is broken up into two distinct types: Unit tests and End-to-end (e2e) tests. Both types use Jest as the JavaScript testing solution. The browser environment for end-to-end testing is done using Puppeteer.

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) - A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
